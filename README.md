# BMI-Calculator

In this project I have built the BMI calculator. BMI stands for Body Mass Index. 
It checks whether you are within a healthy weight range for your height or not.
The BMI Calculator is hosted on a live server. You can calculate your BMI by visiting the following URL: [BMI Calculator](
